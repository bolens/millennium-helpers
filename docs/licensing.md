# Licensing

Canonical licensing notes for Millennium Helpers and the Millennium client these
tools install. Keep this page, the README **License** section, man-page
`LICENSE` sections, and `third_party/` in sync — `make check-docs` enforces
the cross-links (see also the [docs index](README.md)).

| Artifact | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) | **Millennium Helpers** (this repo) — MIT, Copyright © bolens |
| [`third_party/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md`](../third_party/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md) | Vendored copy of the **Millennium client** MIT notice |
| [Upstream `LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/blob/main/LICENSE.md) | Source of truth for Project Millennium’s license text |
| [`third_party/README.md`](../third_party/README.md) | Why vendored third-party notices live here |

## Summary

- **Helpers** (scripts, packaging recipes, MCP server, docs in this repo) are MIT —
  see [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE). User-facing overview: [README § License](../README.md#license).
- **Millennium** (the Steam Client homebrew framework from
  [SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium))
  is a **separate** project, also MIT-licensed by Project Millennium. Installing or
  upgrading it via these helpers is subject to Millennium’s terms.
- This project is **not affiliated with or endorsed by** SteamClientHomebrew,
  Project Millennium, or Valve Corporation. Steam® is a trademark of Valve Corporation.

## On install / upgrade

`millennium upgrade` (Linux and Windows; see also `millennium-upgrade(1)`) places a
copy of Millennium’s MIT notice as `LICENSE` next to the installed client binaries.
That satisfies MIT’s requirement to include the copyright and permission notice with
redistributed copies. Release packages for Millennium itself do not always ship a
license file inside the archive; helpers supply the vendored text (or fetch upstream,
or use an embedded fallback).

Implementation: Go `InstallLicense` in `go/internal/upgrade` (see that package for the
client-side LICENSE placement). The vendored helpers copy
(`third_party/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md`) is installed beside the helpers (e.g.
`/usr/lib/millennium-helpers/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md`) via `millennium install`,
Homebrew, Nix, Arch PKGBUILDs, and the Windows installer.

## Keeping this in sync

When changing license text, attribution, or how upgrade installs notices:

1. Update upstream-facing links and the vendored file (`third_party/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md`).
2. Update this page and [README § License](../README.md#license).
3. Confirm man-page `LICENSE` sections still reference this doc.
4. Run `make check-docs` (also part of `make lint` / `make check-all`).

## Compiled dependency notices

[`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`](../THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt) retains the Go runtime
and module license texts for the inspected dependency versions. Include it with
compiled dispatchers and retain the separate Millennium notice. See
[third-party scope](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for other imported material.
