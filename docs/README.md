# Documentation

Index of Millennium Helpers docs. `make check-docs` enforces that this index,
the project [README](../README.md) **Further reading** table, and each guide’s
**Related** section stay cross-linked.

## Manual pages

Installed with the helpers (`man millennium`, `man millennium-diag`, …). Each page
has a `LICENSE` section pointing at [licensing.md](licensing.md); command-specific
pages also point at the matching guide where one exists (for example
`millennium-mcp(1)` → [mcp.md](mcp.md)).

## Keeping links in sync

1. Add or rename a guide under `docs/` → update **this index**, [README § Further reading](../README.md#further-reading), and topical **Related** footers.
2. Run `make check-docs` (includes licensing checks; also part of `make lint` / `make check-all`).
