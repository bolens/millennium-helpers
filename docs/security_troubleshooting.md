## Security Design

To allow background user-level timers to run updates that modify system directories, the updater scripts must run with elevated privileges.

This setup achieves this securely:
1. **Sudoers Autoconfiguration (Linux)**: During `sudo ./install.sh`, the installer detects the original invoking user (`SUDO_USER`) and automatically configures a secure drop-in file at `/etc/sudoers.d/millennium-helpers`.
2. **Write-Protected Scripts**: Helper scripts are copied into `/usr/local/bin/` owned by `root:root` with `755` permissions, meaning normal users cannot edit or tamper with them.
3. **Task Scheduler (Windows)**: Scheduled tasks are registered with elevated credentials using native Windows Task Scheduler security boundaries.
4. **Channel allow-list**: Scheduler enable paths only accept `stable|beta|main`. Poisoned `update_channel` values in config are ignored on load and rejected before embedding into cron/systemd/Task Scheduler command lines.
5. **Scheduler-only hooks**: `pre-update` / `post-update` require `MILLENNIUM_SCHEDULER=1` (set by the unit/cron). Manual invocation is refused.
6. **Release checksums and provenance**: Non-`main` helper/client downloads hard-fail if the `.sha256` sidecar is missing or mismatches. Tip-of-main installs require `--allow-unsigned-main` / `-AllowUnsignedMain`. Same-origin GitHub sidecars are TOFU; published helper releases additionally include a checksummed SPDX SBOM and GitHub build-provenance attestations.
7. **Resource ceilings**: Go HTTP downloads are capped at 512 MiB and API responses at 4 MiB. Go archive extraction rejects more than 100,000 entries, any file larger than 512 MiB, or more than 2 GiB of total extracted data.
8. **Local archives**: `millennium upgrade --file` requires `--sha256` or explicit `--insecure-skip-verify`.
9. **Doctor**: Syncing helper scripts over root-owned install paths requires `millennium diag doctor --yes` after a verified release download.
10. **Archive extract**: Theme and Windows client zips reject path-traversal members (`..` / absolute paths).

Arch packages grant `%wheel` passwordless access to the four privileged commands. On a shared desktop with broad wheel membership, prefer the curl installer's user-specific sudoers rule.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Steam shows a blank/black screen after upgrading Millennium
This is usually caused by outdated CEF cached files. Run the repair utility to fix local permissions and clear Steam's htmlcache:
```bash
# Linux
sudo millennium repair

# Windows
millennium repair
```

### The background timer is not running updates
1. Check the timer status:
   ```bash
   millennium schedule status
   ```
2. Verify that passwordless sudo (Linux) or Scheduled Tasks (Windows) are configured correctly.
3. If you want the updates to run even when you are logged out of your session on Linux, enable user lingering:
   ```bash
   loginctl enable-linger $USER
   ```

### Steam Deck or Flatpak Steam issues
Hooks, sandbox overrides, Desktop Mode install, and post-SteamOS-update recovery are covered in the [Steam Deck & Flatpak Troubleshooting](steam_deck.md) guide.
