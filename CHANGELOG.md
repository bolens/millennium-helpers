and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Go consumers must migrate imports from `github.com/bolens/millenium-helpers` to `github.com/bolens/millennium-helpers`. Installer, packaging, and documentation URLs use the corrected repository name.

### Fixed
- Unix Steam discovery rejects Wine paths instead of treating them as native installations
- From-source packaging accepts the controlled release archive layout

### Security
- Release and CI builds use Go 1.25.13 to include standard-library vulnerability fixes

## [3.2.1] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed
- Fish top-level completion offers `millennium config`, with dispatcher entries generated from the CLI contract to prevent future omissions

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- Native `millennium config` commands inspect client settings, toggle installed plugins, select or disable themes, and identify/disable components with directly attributed recent errors without relying on Steam's settings UI

### Fixed
- Error remediation ignores recognized prior Steam sessions, tolerates missing component directories, and rejects action-specific options outside their valid CLI and MCP actions

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- Reversible `millennium injection status|disable|enable` controls preserve configuration, plugins, themes, and installed client files
- Injection safety checks refuse foreign or conflicting bootstrap files and report partial hook states

### Changed
- MCP registration uses `millennium mcp`, and Windows scheduled updates resolve the unified dispatcher directly

### Removed
- Retired argv0 twin dispatch, legacy execution environment switches, metadata migration, and the unused legacy Go package

## [3.0.2] - 2026-08-05

### Changed
- Repository agent guidance documents safe contribution and validation practices
- Release CI pins third-party actions, verifies downloaded tooling, and publishes build-provenance attestations

### Fixed
- Remote archives, bootstrap downloads, and GitHub API responses enforce path, entry-count, and size limits
- MCP child processes terminate as a process tree when requests time out
- Configuration updates and the setup wizard preserve malformed or unreadable state instead of overwriting it
- Linux all-users upgrades link hooks for the target user
- Failed Windows installs and rollbacks restore the previous installation transactionally
- Backup retention applies configured count and maximum age on Linux and Windows
- Theme bulk updates and uninstall cleanup report partial failures

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Arch PKGBUILD/`.SRCINFO` `millennium-helpers.sudoers` sha256sums after the v3.0.0 peel (makepkg validity check)
- `check-version` asserts Arch sudoers checksums stay in sync (skips absent package trees in CI fixtures)
- MCP JSON spacing helper no longer sizes buffers with `len+N` (CodeQL `go/allocation-size-overflow`)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- `millennium install` / `millennium uninstall` (Go): checkout/fixture installs, release/main network download + SHA verify, Linux sudoers, Windows User PATH + completion profile hooks, interactive schedule setup wizard handoff
- Thin Unix `install.sh` bootstrap to `millennium install` (piped Windows `install.ps1` removed; use Scoop/Winget/standalone `millennium.exe`)
- Contract-driven façade sync (`make sync-cli-facade`): completion lists/flags, man OPTIONS, MCP `InputSchema`, and MCP dispatch allowlists from [`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](spec/cli-contract.yaml)
- Go owns install.sh bootstrap and CLI smoke coverage formerly under shell/Pester (`test_install.sh`, `install.Tests.ps1`, feature greps in `go.yml`)

### Removed
- Checkout Bash/PowerShell feature scripts (`scripts/millennium-*.sh`, `scripts/windows/millennium-*.ps1`); feature entrypoint is `millennium` only
- Feature Bash/Pester suites retired in favor of Go unit tests and `go.yml` smokes
- Fat Bash/PowerShell installer bodies (replaced by Go `millennium install`; Unix keeps thin `install.sh`)
- Install-time shared libs (`scripts/common.sh`, `scripts/lib/*`, `scripts/windows/common.ps1`, `scripts/windows/lib/*`); release asset helpers moved to `scripts/ci/release_assets.sh`
- Windows `scripts/windows/install.ps1` bootstrap (Scoop/Winget/Chocolatey / standalone `millennium.exe` replace it)
- Unification roadmap/audit maintainer trackers (Go peel complete; see contract + CONTRIBUTING)

### Changed
- Release payloads and installers stop shipping/copying feature scripts; uninstall/wizard invoke `millennium` / `millennium.exe`
- **Breaking:** PATH installs only `millennium` (no long-name `millennium-*` twins). Use `millennium <cmd>`; uninstall still removes legacy twins. argv0 twins remain supported if present.
- Completions and sudoers allowlist `millennium` / `millennium <cmd>` only (no new long-name registration)
- CI feature coverage is [`go.yml`](.github/workflows/go.yml) on Linux, Windows, and macOS; [`test-suite.yml`](.github/workflows/test-suite.yml) keeps install/unit/packaging/completions
- User docs and packaging post-install messages prefer `millennium <cmd>` (man filenames and MCP host `command: millennium-mcp` unchanged)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Unified Go CLI (`make build` → `bin/millennium`) for schedule, theme, diag/doctor, upgrade, purge, repair, and MCP (`millennium mcp` / PATH `millennium-mcp`)
- Machine-readable CLI contract ([`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](spec/cli-contract.yaml)) with `make check-cli-contract`, dual-OS `go.yml` smokes, and Linux quality gates (`go vet`, `gofmt`, golangci-lint, govulncheck)
- Packaging three-variant matrix (from-source / `-bin` / `-git`) for Arch, Homebrew, Scoop, Nix; plus deb, rpm, and Chocolatey ([packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md)); release CD embeds per-OS Go binaries and waits on a broader green CI gate
- PATH long-name argv0 twins: installed `millennium-{upgrade,schedule,theme,diag,repair,purge,mcp}` are the Go binary (Windows `.cmd` / Scoop shims invoke `millennium <cmd>`)
- Shared Go packages for Steam lifecycle (`go/internal/steam`), CLI logging (`go/internal/logging`), and zip-slip–safe extract (`go/internal/archive`)
- Native schedule systemd scopes (system + user), upgrade sudo handoff on Linux, Windows Task Scheduler enable/disable, and interactive schedule setup wizard

### Changed
- Installers hard-require the Go dispatcher for PATH `millennium`; no shell/PowerShell PATH dispatcher fallback
- Feature long-name entrypoints peel onto Go; checkout Bash/PS scripts remain as development fallbacks (installed PATH uses twins)
- Windows scheduled updates invoke `millennium.exe upgrade` / `theme update`; Unix systemd/launchd/cron invoke `millennium schedule|upgrade|theme` (rewritten on next `schedule enable`)
- Release assets are versioned and OS/arch-split; from-source packaging uses controlled `-src` archives (no GitHub autoarchive URLs)
- Docs and audit/roadmap describe present-tense Go ownership (phase/graduation jargon removed)

### Removed
- Shell/PowerShell PATH dispatchers (`millennium.sh` / `millennium.ps1` and install escape hatches)
- Feature dual libs peeled into Go (schedule/theme/upgrade/repair/purge/diag dual modules)
- Dead shared shell libs superseded by Go (`steam.sh` / `Steam.ps1`, `archive.sh`, `github.sh`, `backup.sh`)
- Python MCP hatch (`millennium-mcp.py` / `MILLENNIUM_MCP_PYTHON`)

## [2.6.2] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Windows↔Unix parity: schedule `config` under StrictMode; scheduled task uses `-Yes -Quiet`, theme update, and `updater.log`
- Windows upgrade honors `backup_max_age_days` and accepts GNU-style channel/force/file/rollback flags
- Windows repair supports `-SkipTheme` / `--skip-theme` and refreshes themes after force reinstall
- Setup wizard (Unix + Windows) preserves `backup_limit` / `backup_max_age_days` when rewriting config

## [2.6.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Arch `-git` packaging follows AUR VCS policy: no perpetual `pkgver` sync on every commit; `pkgver()` is authoritative at `makepkg` time; `.SRCINFO` regenerates only when the `-git` recipe changes (`make sync-git-srcinfo`)

### Fixed
- Portable packaging CI sed (GNU vs BSD/macOS) and Windows InstallTrack I/O so Cross-Platform Test Suite stays green
- Diag install-track meta no longer breaks when `USERPROFILE` is unset or tests mock `Get-Content`

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Helpers install tracks (`release` / `main` / `tag` / `checkout`) with `install-meta.json`, `--track`/`--tag` (Unix) and `-Track`/`-Tag` (Windows)
- Auto-migrate legacy installs without meta on first install/diag/doctor touch
- Winget tip-of-main manifests (`packaging/winget-git/`, `bolens.millenniumhelpers.git`)
- Millennium client channel `main` (tip-of-development) alongside `stable`/`beta` — separate from helpers track
- Diag JSON fields `helpers_track` / `helpers_ref`; track-aware doctor sync

### Changed
- Doctor and update checks follow the recorded helpers track (pinned tags stay pinned; `-git` packages are not compared to release tags)

### Fixed
- `sync-stable-srcinfo` no longer truncates `.SRCINFO` when `makepkg --printsrcinfo` fails (e.g. missing `install=` file in test trees)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Versioned Arch package (`packaging/millennium-helpers`) built from the Linux release tarball; release CD bumps pkgver + sha256 alongside Formula/Scoop/Winget/Nix
- Scoop `millennium-helpers-git` nightly manifest (tip of `main` via GitHub archive)
- Nix flake packages: `millennium-helpers` (release tarball) and `millennium-helpers-git` (flake source / latest commit)

### Changed
- Arch `-git` recipe moved to `packaging/millennium-helpers-git/` (AUR-ready layout)

### Fixed
- `millennium-schedule setup` under sudo verifies passwordless rules for the real user (`sudo -U`), matching doctor

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Modular `millennium-diag` libraries on Linux (`scripts/lib/diag_*.sh`) and Windows (`scripts/windows/lib/Diag*.ps1`)
- Install-method detection (pacman/scoop/winget/manual/mixed) with release-tag comparison
- Doctor cleanup of unmanaged leftovers before package-upgrade hints
- PowerShell completion health checks and doctor repair
- `-Yes` / `--yes` auto scoop/winget/pacman package upgrade when helpers are outdated
- JSON fields: `install_method`, `mixed_install_ok`, `helpers_checkout`, `latest_release_tag`, `completions_ok`

### Fixed
- Pacman upgrades no longer blocked by unmanaged completion leftovers; doctor refuses to overwrite package-owned files
- Empty `DIAG_TEST_OBSOLETE_LIST` correctly means “no obsolete candidates” in tests
- Winget package ID uses `bolens.millenniumhelpers`
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 no longer fails to parse diag modules (ASCII-only sources; Scoop profile hook no longer calls `scoop` at profile load)

### Changed
- Thin loaders: Linux `diag.sh` (replaces `diag_report.sh`), Windows `Diag.ps1` (replaces `DiagReport.ps1`)
- Manual installs sync helper scripts from the latest release tarball/zip instead of `main`

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- PowerShell Tab completions with installer profile hooks (Windows + Scoop)
- Cross-shell completion tests (bash/zsh/fish/nushell) and nested zsh simulation
- Homebrew bash/zsh completion symlinks and Nushell completion install
- Isolated prefix install/uninstall coverage in `test_install.sh`

### Fixed
- Fish completions no longer ship bare `VERSION_PLACEHOLDER` tokens
- `sudo millennium-schedule` reaches the user systemd bus via shared `sysctl_user`
- Uninstall disables cron as well as systemd/LaunchAgent schedulers
- Windows uninstall removes the `MillenniumUpdate` scheduled task
- Shared library resolution works from Homebrew-style `prefix/bin` layouts
- Cron enable/disable under sudo targets the invoking user's crontab
- PKGBUILD conflict cleanup docs include bare `millennium` artifacts

### Changed
- Linux installer also installs Nushell completions into the user config path
- Release Windows zip includes `completions/powershell/`
- Manual uninstall docs cover PowerShell hooks, state dirs, and Scoop hooks

## [2.2.1] - 2026-07-10

### Security
- Verify SHA256 checksums in piped `install.sh` against release `.sha256` sidecars
- Verify SHA256 checksums during Windows `millennium-upgrade` (parity with Linux)
- Restrict Windows `config.json` ACLs when writing `github_token`

### Fixed
- Include `scripts/millennium-mcp.py` in the trimmed Windows release zip / Scoop CI staging
- Update standalone installer tests for trimmed release archive layout
- Republish release assets so packaging checksums match the Windows zip that includes MCP

### Changed
- Wire `test_millennium_dispatcher.sh` and `test_packaging_ci.sh` into the CI matrix
- Slim local `tests/run_tests.sh` to source shared assertions and defer packaging gates to CI

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-09
