# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

https://github.com/bolens/millennium-helpers/security/advisories/new

Do **not** open a public issue for vulnerabilities that could enable privilege escalation, supply-chain tampering, or credential theft.

Include:
- Affected version / commit
- Platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, Steam Deck)
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (if known)

We aim to acknowledge reports within a few days and ship fixes as quickly as practical.

## Security Design Overview

Millennium Helpers manages Steam Client homebrew installs and may elevate privileges for system-wide updates. Key controls:

- **Linux sudoers**: install configures a narrow NOPASSWD allow-list under `/etc/sudoers.d/millennium-helpers` for specific helper commands only
- **Write-protected scripts**: installed binaries are root-owned (`755`) so unprivileged users cannot rewrite them
- **Release integrity**: piped installers and Millennium upgrades verify SHA256 checksums from published `.sha256` sidecars before extracting archives. Sidecar absence is a hard failure (except tip-of-main, which requires `--allow-unsigned-main`)
- **Resource limits**: Go HTTP downloads are capped at 512 MiB and API responses at 4 MiB; Go archive extraction rejects more than 100,000 entries, files larger than 512 MiB, or more than 2 GiB of aggregate output
- **Checksum trust model**: `.sha256` sidecars are same-origin GitHub TOFU (archive + digest from the same release). They detect transport corruption and accidental mix-ups, not a fully compromised GitHub release. Prefer package managers (AUR, Homebrew, Scoop, Winget) when available
- **Release provenance**: releases include a checksummed SPDX JSON SBOM and GitHub build-provenance attestations for published assets
- **Update channel allow-list**: `update_channel` must be `stable`, `beta`, or `main` wherever it is loaded or embedded into systemd/cron/Task Scheduler jobs
- **Config secrets**: `github_token` in helpers config is stored with restricted permissions (`chmod 600` on Unix; ACL lockdown on Windows). GitHub API auth uses curl `--config` so the token is not exposed on process argv
- **MCP server**: tools that escalate or mutate the system require explicit confirmation / allow-lists (see `docs/mcp.md`). Windows elevation uses `-EncodedCommand` rather than string-interpolated `ArgumentList`
- **Doctor script sync**: overwriting root-owned helper binaries requires `doctor --yes` and a verified release archive
- **Theme archives**: zip members with `..` or absolute paths are rejected before extract; `activeTheme` path components are sanitized under repair

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release on `main`. Older tags are not generally backported unless a critical issue warrants it.
