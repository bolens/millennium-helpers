# Contributing to Millennium Helpers

Thanks for contributing. This repo provides cross-platform CLI helpers for [Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium) (Steam Client homebrew). The GitHub repository and product use the canonical **Millennium** spelling.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bolens/millennium-helpers.git
cd millennium-helpers
make setup      # installs shellcheck + ruff via your package manager
make check-all  # lint + Go tests (feature parity) + install-time Bash suite
```

Alternatives:
- **Dev Container**: open the repo in a container (PowerShell, Docker-in-Docker, shellcheck, ruff, zsh/fish/nushell, Pester). Then run `make check-all`.
- **Nix**: `nix develop` for a shell with bash, python, shellcheck, and ruff (does **not** include `pwsh` or Docker).
- **Windows Pester**: `make test-windows` (requires PowerShell 7+ / `pwsh`).

## Development requirements

Tools fall into three tiers. Install what matches the work you are doing.

### Core (needed for `make check-all`)

| Tool | Used for | Install notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bash 4+ (3.2 OK on macOS for scripts under test) | Running scripts and `tests/run_tests.sh` | System shell |
| `make` | Local targets | Usually via build-essential / Xcode CLT |
| `git` | Clone, hooks, PKGBUILD pkgver | System package |
| Python 3 | Packaging YAML checks, some unit tests | `python3` + PyYAML for `make check-winget` |
| **Go 1.22+** | `make test-go` (included in `check-all`) / `make build` | [Install Go](https://go.dev/dl/); CI uses `CGO_ENABLED=0` |
| [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) | `make lint` | `make setup`, or brew/pacman/apt/dnf |
| [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) | Lint/format `scripts/ci/*.py` | `make setup`, or brew/pacman/apt/dnf |
| `jq`, `curl`, `unzip` | Script runtime + tests | System packages |

`make setup` only installs **shellcheck** and **ruff**. Everything else above is assumed present on a normal Linux/macOS/devcontainer host.

### Recommended (full local parity with CI)

| Tool | Used for | Install notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`)** | `make test-windows`, Windows script work | [Install PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell); Dev Container feature includes it |
| **Pester** | Windows unit tests | `Install-Module Pester -Scope CurrentUser` (Dev Container post-create does this) |
| **Go 1.22+** | Also listed under Core; needed anytime you touch `go/` beyond `check-all` | Same install notes as Core |
| **PyYAML** | `make check-cli-contract` / `make check-winget` | `pip install pyyaml` |
| **zsh**, **fish**, **Nushell (≥ 0.114)** | Completion syntax/runtime smokes in `make check-completions` / CI completions workflow | Distro packages or [Nushell releases](https://www.nushell.sh/); missing shells are skipped with a warning, not a hard fail |
| `gh` | Release runbook / inspecting Actions | [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) |
| `pre-commit` | Optional git hooks | `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push` |
| `actionlint` | Workflow lint (pre-commit) | [actionlint releases](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/releases) or distro/`go install`; skipped if missing |
| `gitleaks` | Secret scan (pre-commit) | [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks); skipped if missing (`detect-private-key` from pre-commit-hooks still runs) |

### Optional (release / cross-distro)

| Tool | Used for | Install notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Docker** | `make test-debian` / `test-ubuntu` / `test-fedora` / `test-all-distros` | Docker Engine or Docker Desktop; Dev Container enables Docker-in-Docker |
| `mandoc` | Local man-page lint (also in CI) | Distro package |

### What each environment provides

| Environment | Core lint/test | `pwsh` + Pester | Docker distro matrix | Go CLI | Extra shells (zsh/fish/nu) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Host + `make setup` | Yes (after deps) | Manual | Manual | Manual (`go`) | Manual |
| **Dev Container** (`.devcontainer/`) | Yes | Yes | Yes (DinD) | Yes (Go feature) | Yes |
| **`nix develop`** | Yes (shellcheck/ruff + Go) | No | No | Yes | No |

Before a release, follow [docs/release_runbook.md](docs/release_runbook.md): at minimum `make check-all` (lint + test-go + test) and `make test-windows`; use `make test-all-distros` when Docker is available.

## Documentation

Guide index: **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)**. When adding or renaming a guide, update that index, [README § Further reading](README.md#further-reading), topical **Related** footers, and run `make check-docs`.

| Doc | When to read |
| --- | --- |
| [docs/release_runbook.md](docs/release_runbook.md) | Cutting a release |
| [spec/cli-contract.yaml](spec/cli-contract.yaml) | Commands / flags / MCP / façades (`make sync-cli-facade`) |

## Project layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `install.sh` | Thin Linux/macOS bootstrap → `millennium install` / `uninstall` |
| `scripts/ci/` | Release/packaging CI helpers (e.g. `release_assets.sh`) |
| `go/` | Go CLI (`cmd/millennium`); features + installer under `go/internal/` |
| `go/` + PATH `millennium-mcp` | Native MCP stdio server (`millennium mcp`) |
| `spec/cli-contract.yaml` | **Source of truth** for commands / flags / platforms |
| `man/` | Manual pages (`millennium-*.1`) for every user-facing command |
| `docs/` | User/maintainer guides (index: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)) |
| `Formula/` | Homebrew formulas (`millennium-helpers.rb` from-source + `head`; `millennium-helpers-bin.rb`) |
| `packaging/` | Arch / Scoop / Winget / deb / rpm / Chocolatey — see [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md) |
| `completions/` | Bash / Zsh / Fish / Nushell / PowerShell completions |
| `tests/` | Install/packaging suites (`tests/run_tests.sh`); feature coverage in `go.yml` |
| `tests/windows/` | Pester tests for Windows install bootstrap / completions |

Feature commands live in Go only. Do not reintroduce install-time `scripts/lib` / `scripts/windows/lib` trees.

## Adding or changing a command

1. Update [`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](spec/cli-contract.yaml) first (flags, platforms, MCP properties; `short:` for dispatcher commands).
2. Run `make sync-cli-facade` to refresh marked façades (dispatcher /
   subcommands / channels / bash+PS flags / man OPTIONS / MCP `InputSchema` /
   MCP dispatch allowlists).
3. Implement in Go under `go/` (`millennium <cmd>`; leftover argv0 twins via `commandFromArgv0`).
4. Update dispatcher help/registration in `go/cmd/millennium` when adding commands.
5. Keep `--help` / `-h` accurate and exit `0` on help.
6. On unknown options, print usage and exit non-zero.
7. Keep `man/millennium-<name>.1` NAME/DESCRIPTION/EXAMPLES prose accurate (OPTIONS sync via façade; `.TH` date like `"July 9, 2026"`; `make check-man`).
8. Add or extend Go tests / `go.yml` smokes for unique seams.
9. Prefer `--dry-run` for destructive paths; require confirmation (or `-y`/`--yes`) for irreversible actions like purge.
10. Run `make check-cli-contract` (also part of `make lint`; includes façade `--check`).

## Linux / Windows parity

Prefer one Go implementation. Keep [`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](spec/cli-contract.yaml)
aligned and cover Linux / Windows / macOS in [`.github/workflows/go.yml`](.github/workflows/go.yml).

**Go surfaces:**

- [ ] Contract + completions/man/MCP stay aligned (`make check-cli-contract`)
- [ ] Covered by `make test-go` and the Linux / Windows / macOS jobs in [`.github/workflows/go.yml`](.github/workflows/go.yml)

**Cross-OS checklist:**

- [ ] Flag / subcommand exists on both OSes (**or** marked `os_only` in `spec/cli-contract.yaml`)
- [ ] Dry-run behavior matches
- [ ] Help text documents the same options
- [ ] Unique seams fail `go.yml` (or Go unit tests) when not covered by existing smokes
- [ ] Contract + completions/man/MCP stay aligned (`make check-cli-contract`)

PATH installs only `millennium`; do not reintroduce long-name twins. Keep
`commandFromArgv0` working for leftover binaries from older installs.

## Testing

See [Development requirements](#development-requirements) for tools each target needs.

```bash
make test              # local Bash unit + behavioral suite (install / packaging / completions)
make lint              # shellcheck + ruff (+ version/man/docs/completions/cli-contract gates)
make check-all         # lint + test-go + test (feature parity is test-go / go.yml)
make test-windows      # Pester install + completions (requires pwsh; not part of check-all)
make test-go           # Go unit tests (requires Go; part of check-all; CI smokes in go.yml)
make build             # bin/millennium Go CLI
make test-all-distros  # local + Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora via Docker (requires Docker)
```

## Versioning

`VERSION` at the repo root is the helpers package version (aligned with Scoop, Winget,
Homebrew, Arch from-source/`-bin`, Nix, deb/rpm/Chocolatey, and `pyproject.toml`).
Installers copy it next to the shared libraries so `--version` / `-Version` work after
install. Prefer git tags `vX.Y.Z` that match `VERSION`.

**Packaging matrix** (AUR-standard naming): plain `millennium-helpers` = tagged
**from-source**; `millennium-helpers-bin` = published **release assets**;
`millennium-helpers-git` = tip of `main`. Winget and Chocolatey are **bin** only
(plus Winget git). Details: [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md).

Tip-of-main packages (`packaging/millennium-helpers-git`, Scoop `millennium-helpers-git`,
Winget `bolens.millenniumhelpers.git`, Nix `#millennium-helpers-git`) are **not** tied to
`VERSION`; they track git HEAD.

### Helpers install tracks vs client channel

| Concept | Values | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Helpers track** | `release` (default), `main`, `tag`, `checkout` | `install-meta.json`; `millennium install --track` / `--tag` (Unix: `install.sh` forwards the same flags) |
| **Client channel** | `stable`, `beta`, `main` | `config.json` → `update_channel`; `millennium upgrade --channel`; schedule enable |

Doctor syncs helpers against the recorded track (pinned tags stay pinned). Legacy installs without meta are auto-migrated on first install/diag/doctor touch.

### Make targets

| Target | Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make bump-version VERSION=X.Y.Z` | `scripts/ci/bump-version.sh` | Pre-tag bump: write `VERSION` + packaging **versions/URLs**; **keep existing hashes**; regenerate Arch from-source + `-bin` `.SRCINFO`; run `check-version` |
| `make check-version` | `scripts/ci/check-version-sync.sh` | Assert packaging version strings + URL shape match `VERSION` (also runs inside `make lint`) |
| `make check-packaging` | `scripts/ci/check-packaging-manifests.sh` | Structural checks for Scoop/Winget/Chocolatey/deb/rpm/Formula matrix |
| `make sync-stable-srcinfo` | `scripts/ci/sync-stable-srcinfo.sh` | Regenerate from-source Arch `.SRCINFO` from `PKGBUILD` (`--check` fails if stale) |
| `make sync-bin-srcinfo` | `scripts/ci/sync-bin-srcinfo.sh` | Regenerate `-bin` Arch `.SRCINFO` from `PKGBUILD` |
| `make sync-git-srcinfo` | `scripts/ci/sync-git-srcinfo.sh` | Regenerate Arch `-git` `.SRCINFO` when the recipe changes (`pkgver` drift ignored; `pkgver()` owns the version at build time) |

Post-tag (release CD only): `scripts/ci/update-packaging-versions.sh <ver> <linux_sha> <windows_sha> [repo] [tag_tar_sha] [tag_zip_sha]`
fills real SHA256s / SRI hashes for from-source + bin Formula/Scoop/Arch/Nix/deb/rpm/Chocolatey and Winget.

### Pre-tag bump (preferred)

```bash
make bump-version VERSION=X.Y.Z
# edit CHANGELOG.md under ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD  (manual)
make check-version   # already run by bump-version; safe to re-run
```

`bump-version` updates:

- `VERSION`, `pyproject.toml`
- Formula from-source (`-src.tar.gz`) + Formula-bin (per-OS/arch tarball) URLs
- Scoop from-source (tag zip) + Scoop-bin (Windows zip) versions/URLs
- Winget installer URL + `PackageVersion` / `ReleaseDate`
- Arch from-source + `-bin` `pkgver`/`pkgrel` and both `.SRCINFO` files
- deb control / rpm `.spec` / Chocolatey nuspec + install script versions
- `nix/release-info.nix` **version only** (hashes unchanged until assets exist)

It does **not** edit `CHANGELOG.md`. Do **not** hand-edit `.SRCINFO` — use `bump-version` or
`make sync-stable-srcinfo` / `make sync-bin-srcinfo`.

Before the tag exists, Nix/Arch CI may **skip** building the `-bin` release-tarball package
(asset 404); that is expected. Tip-of-main / `-git` builds still run.

### What `check-version` validates

- `pyproject.toml` `version`
- Scoop from-source + `-bin` versions and URL shapes
- Winget `PackageVersion` on all three manifests + installer URL shape
- Homebrew from-source + `-bin` Formula versions/URL shapes
- Arch from-source + `-bin` `pkgver` + `.SRCINFO` sync
- `nix/release-info.nix` `version`
- deb / rpm / Chocolatey version fields

Placeholder / previous-release checksums are allowed; version strings and URL **shape** must
match. Tip-of-main / `-git` packages are excluded.

### Cutting a release

Follow [docs/release_runbook.md](docs/release_runbook.md) end-to-end (local `make lint` /
`make test` / `make test-windows`, `make bump-version`, CI green, then tag). Do not tag until
ShellCheck and the test suite pass locally and on `main`.

Tagging `vX.Y.Z` runs the release workflow:

1. Wait for **Test Suite + ShellCheck + Completions** on that commit
2. Draft a GitHub release with versioned OS/arch assets (`millennium-helpers-vX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, Darwin packs, `…-windows-amd64.zip`, `-src.tar.gz`/`.zip`), matching embedded Go dispatchers, standalone `millennium-vX.Y.Z-…` binaries, plus checksum sidecars
3. Open a packaging PR that bumps from-source + bin packaging (and Winget/Chocolatey) and fills SHA256s from the draft upload
4. **If packaging CI passes:** squash-merge the PR and publish the draft release automatically
5. **If packaging CI fails (or never starts):** leave the draft release and packaging PR for manual recovery (fix, merge, then publish)

The Unix piped installer (`install.sh`) and Go `millennium install` download the **latest published** trimmed release asset when needed (override with `MILLENNIUM_HELPERS_RELEASE_URL`).

Repo secret `PACKAGING_PAT` is **required** for the automatic path: a classic PAT with `contents` + `pull-requests`, and permission to merge into `main` under any branch protection. PRs opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger workflows, so without this secret the finalize job cannot wait on packaging CI.

Local checks:
```bash
make check-version         # VERSION ↔ packaging (see Versioning above)
make bump-version VERSION=X.Y.Z   # pre-tag bump (then edit CHANGELOG)
make sync-stable-srcinfo   # regenerate from-source Arch .SRCINFO only
make sync-bin-srcinfo      # regenerate -bin Arch .SRCINFO only
make sync-git-srcinfo      # regenerate -git .SRCINFO after recipe edits
make check-man             # every command has a man page
make check-docs            # docs index / Related footers / man / licensing cross-links
make check-licensing       # alias for check-docs
make check-winget          # Winget manifest structure (docs-only; no winget validate)
```

Optional local hooks (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`):

```bash
pip install pre-commit   # if needed
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

**pre-commit** runs: remote [pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks) sanity checks (private keys, merge conflicts, large files, symlinks, trailing whitespace, EOF newlines, LF line endings), plus local shellcheck, ruff check + format `--check`, VERSION presence, Arch from-source/`-bin`/`-git` `.SRCINFO` sync when those recipes change, packaging version sync, winget manifests, completions tests (when `completions/` changes), man-page coverage, docs cross-links (guides + licensing), actionlint (workflows; skipped if not installed), and gitleaks on staged changes (skipped if not installed).

**pre-push** runs: `make lint`, and `make test-windows` when the push range touches `tests/windows/`, `completions/powershell/`, or `go/internal/install/` (skipped if `pwsh` is missing).

## Style

- Bash: `set -euo pipefail` in remaining bootstraps/CI scripts; prefer Go for product logic.
- macOS ships Bash 3.2: under `set -u`, empty `"${arr[@]}"` / `"${arr[*]}"` is unbound. Prefer `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` (or a length guard) when an array may be empty. Avoid `"${arr[@]:-}"` (it iterates once with an empty value).
- Honor `NO_COLOR` (and `FORCE_COLOR` when forcing color).
- PowerShell: `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest`; gate debug noise behind `MILLENNIUM_DEBUG` or `-Verbose` (completions + packaging tools).
- Do not commit packaging build artifacts (makepkg `pkg/`/`src/`/`*.pkg.tar.*`, `*.deb`/`*.rpm`/`*.nupkg`, release tarballs, staged `scripts/windows/millennium.exe`). See `.gitignore`.
- Do **not** bump Arch `-git` `pkgver` on every commit ([AUR VCS policy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_submission_guidelines)). `pkgver()` recalculates at `makepkg` time; regenerate `.SRCINFO` only when the `-git` recipe changes (`make sync-git-srcinfo`).
- Keep Arch from-source/`-bin` `.SRCINFO` current with `make sync-stable-srcinfo` /
  `make sync-bin-srcinfo` (or `make bump-version`). Pre-commit regenerates them when those
  PKGBUILDs change.

## Packaging notes

- See [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md) for the full from-source / bin / git matrix.
- **bin** packages consume versioned GitHub Release assets
  (`millennium-helpers-vX.Y.Z-{os}-{arch}…`), each embedding the matching Go dispatcher.
- **from-source** packages use release `-src.tar.gz` / `-src.zip` + `make build` (or PS scripts only on Scoop).
- Homebrew: do **not** add a redundant `version "X.Y.Z"` when the URL encodes the tag —
  `brew audit` rejects it. Keep `license "MIT"`.
- Scoop is the supported multi-command Windows install path; Scoop `-git` is tip-of-`main`.
- Nix default `packages.millennium-helpers` is from-source; `-bin` / `-git` are separate outputs.
- Winget is git + bin only (docs-only until a single `.exe` installer); Chocolatey is bin-only.
- deb: `packaging/deb/build-from-source.sh` / `build-bin.sh`. rpm: `.spec` files under `packaging/rpm/`.
- `scripts/ci/update-packaging-versions.sh` — post-tag hash fill for the whole VERSION-tied matrix (release CD).
- Arch `-git` stays tip-of-main; do not commit mere `-git` `pkgver` bumps.
- Man-page CI (`scripts/ci/check-man-pages.sh`) fails on mandoc `ERROR`/`FATAL` only; `WARNING`/`STYLE` are printed as notes.
- Docs CI (`scripts/ci/check-docs-crosslinks.sh`) — docs index, Related footers, man→guide links, and licensing attribution; prefer `make check-docs` (`make check-licensing` is an alias).
- Release Linux/Windows assets **must** include `third_party/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md` (see [docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md) and `make check-docs`).

## Licensing

Helpers are MIT ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). The Millennium **client** is a separate MIT project — see **[docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md)** (canonical), [`third_party/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md`](third_party/MILLENNIUM-LICENSE.md), and [upstream `LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

When changing attribution, the vendored notice, upgrade license installation, man-page `LICENSE` sections, Winget descriptions, or release payload contents:

1. Update [docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md) and [README § License](README.md#license).
2. Keep `third_party/README.md` and man-page `LICENSE` sections pointing at the hub.
3. Run `make check-docs` (included in `make lint` / `make check-all`).

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused; include a short summary and test plan.
- Mention any completion, man-page, or docs updates.
- CI must pass (multi-distro + macOS test matrix, ShellCheck, Ruff, man pages, Homebrew audit, completions, packaging checks).
